# Austins Daily Planner Application

The goal of this application is to use existing HTML and CSS code from class and add functionality using javascript and Jquery.  The challenges of this project where to implement Jquery methods such as $(this), moment(), localstorage, $.append and others to create an application that keeps track of the date at the top of the page and has hour blocks which reflect the current time by showing a color for past hours, current hour and future hours on the planner.  The goal of the local storage portion is to have the page maintain use input from the schedule and reprint it if the page is closed and reloaded so that the user is not required to keep the webpage open in order to maintain their schedule.
